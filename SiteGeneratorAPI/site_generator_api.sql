Slide your left arm through the cuff and position the cuff approximately 0.5-inches above the elbow. On the cuff you\'ll notice a green marker; position this marker directly over the artery on the inside of your arm. Next, secure the cuff with the Velcro material. The cuff should make direct contact with your skin, but you should be able to easily fit your index finger between the cuff and your arm.<p>  Place your arm on a table so that the cuff is positioned at the same level as your heart. Rest comfortably in a relaxed environment for at least 15 minutes prior to taking your blood pressure measurement. Once you feel relaxed, simply press the start button and remain still. The cuff will begin to inflate and numbers will appear on the display as the heart symbol flashes. When the measurement is complete, the cuff will deflate, and your blood pressure and pulse rate will display on the screen. If you need to stop the measurement at any time, simply press the on/off button and the monitor will immediately deflate. And remember, always consult your physician for specific information about your blood pressure.<p>  <b>What is IntelliSense?</b><br> The IntelliSense monitor inflates the cuff to the ideal level with each use -- you never have to make any adjustments to select an inflation level. This is especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders because their blood pressure is so likely to fluctuate. The biggest advantage of using the IntelliSense technology is a personalized inflation, every time, for maximum comfort.<p>  <b>The Importance of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</b><br> Doctors, diabetes educators, physician assistants, nurses, and other healthcare professionals all recommend home blood pressure monitoring for various reasons. Home monitoring provides your healthcare professionals with better information to understand and manage your high blood pressure. Many types of hypertension can only be detected by monitoring your blood pressure at home, including:<br>  <ul>  <li>White-Coat Hypertension: blood pressure reading is high in your doctor\'s office but lower at home  <li>Masked Hypertension: blood pressure reading is low in doctor\'s office but higher at home  <li>Morning Hypertension: blood pressure reading is higher in the morning </ul>  Additionally, many factors can affect your blood pressure, including physical exertion, emotional fluctuations, medications, and stress. So having your blood pressure monitored at a pharmacy with an in-store device after you\'ve been shopping or walking around might not provide you with the most accurate measurement. Monitoring your blood pressure at home allows you achieve a relaxed state more easily, and it gives you the flexibility to take your measurements at various times during the day. By keeping track of your home blood pressure readings, you can provide your healthcare professional with a log of your measurements over time. This can help them evaluate the effectiveness or need for medication.<p>  <br clear=\"all\">  <b>What\'s in the Box</b><br> Omron HEM-712CLC blood pressure monitor, large cuff, and instruction manual.','Health and Beauty','B0009XQUE8','Omron','Omron','HEM  712CLC','1',NULL,'Omron','5341','HEALTH_PERSONAL_CARE','Comes with Manufacturer Warranty.'),(14,'Omron','Black','Omron\'s line of Ultra Silent Wrist Monitors provides the freedom to measure your blood pressure on your terms.

INSERT INTO `product_reviews` VALUES (1,'Tracey Taylor','on October 14, 2014','B00KW4PO82',4,'Got this for my husband ... below is his review -Just got this device today - so this is early impressions: I got this monitor as it came highly recommended for accuracy. Even though I really wanted to have a \'new\' iDevice like product that is now being produced by a few other manufacturers. Having a great app/website to help track daily information is a great selling point. Monitoring a person\'s health is hard enough, make it easier by automating the record keeping!Device itself - couldn\'t be easier to operate. Right out of the box, plug in the cuff, plug it in, set the date and time, and hit start. Pretty easy. Quick start instructions were very clear on how to position the cuff, etc. The device seems made to last - really heavy duty build. I have it sitting on my desk in my home office - where I spend most of my day. It doesn\'t look too out of place among all the other items I have on my desk (sort of a neat freak..) I do detach the cuff and put that in a drawer.The is the first bp monitor I\'ve bought, so I have high expectations but not a lot of experience with them. It\'s much more accurate than the device that was used on me during a recent health screening. The readings on the Omron are in line with some of the readings I\'ve gotten from bp monitors I\'ve used in various places.Side benefit - takes and records your heart rate too! Nice! I\'ve been using an app for this. Now I can capture all the information in one go!Bells &amp; whistles - okay, now onto the bells and whistles: I use an iPhone 5 and the app, as of today, is very simple to setup. The app will allow you to create an account with Omronwellness, ask you if you are User 1 or 2 on the device, and automatically start uploading data. It has a nice pic of your latest readings and it tracks all of the data that\'s found on the device. That\'s pretty much it.The downside is that the sync\'ing of the data between the device and your phone is not automatic. You do have to hit a button on the Omron and, possibly, pull down on the image of your last reading (this forces a re-sync). I haven\'t tested all variations of when the data would be updated. I was hoping for more automation. For instance if the device is in use by a particular user, and the iPhone is around - to automatically wake up the app and update the phone. Not sure what the technical hurdles are here, but it would be a nice to have.All of your data gets sent to Omronwellness site automatically from your phone. Using a browser on a desktop (I use a Mac) is pretty easy. We\'re only tracking a few data types, so how exciting can the site be? Here, Omron tries. There are graphs and goals setting, etc. However, having the graphs and goals feature moved over to the app would be a very nice plus.Lastly - and I sincerely wish for this to changed in the near future - the app does not support Apple\'s Heath Kit. I have to manually input my data into Health app. This is a major let down. However, it\'s just a software change and it\'s something the company can do if they have any desire to do.Wrapping up - as this was my first bp monitor, I wanted to error on the side of having a device that accurately read my vitals. That\'s much more important than automating my life. However, I think it\'s really important to make tracking our health automatic, or with only a little fuss, if we are to get people to start looking at their health more seriously. (Baring a life altering event of course...) As the focus on healthcare gets more attention - there are a lot of players in the market that will produce products (apps, etc) that will attempt to make the more technically savvy folks\' lives easier. It\'s will become requirement for future purchase for people I\'m sure. Plus it\'ll make nerds like me really happy to play around with the apps and data points.','Great device - but: APPS! APPS! APPS!'),(2,'Roy G. Biv','on August 7, 2014','B00KW4PO82',5,'I had an Omron-HEM-712C for 10 years: it worked reliably and was accurate and had a decent enough memory. The best things about this new model (to me) are the optional 3-sample averaging, and the Bluetooth connection that downloads to an app on your phone and from there to an online personal account. I like being able to show my record to my doctor but having the record is making ME more consistent about taking my BP regularly and about keeping the positive lifestyle changes going.The cuff is easy to put on; it has a stiff cylinder as part of the cuff and the loose end \"velcros\" itself. The other had the typical soft cuff which I prefer but this one is not uncomfortable. Instead of plugging straight (perpendicularly) into the side of the housing like the 712C, the air tube on this one has a 90 degree fitting that rotates in the port on the machine. It is about the same size and weight is no noisier than my old one.Maybe my commitment will wane but following the advice about when and how to take the measurement means I am seeing more consistent -- and hopefully more accurate -- readings.

Because it uses electrical resitance and calculated \"wing span\" to measure BF%, it\'s possible (due to differences in arm length) that your reading may not be 100% accurate compared to a clinical \"immersion\" test. However, it is definitely consistent!

I highly recommend it.','Great product, woud highly recommend!'),(4,'Michael S.','on July 13, 2014','B00KW4PO82',3,'I purchased this monitor to replace a 15 year old Target branded BP monitor. The measurements between the old Target monitor and the Omron monitor are consistent.The display is back-lit and easy to read.The unit keeps the last 200 readings and there is a switch for \"Person 1\" or \"Person 2\" - I am currently using that for tracking the reading from my left arm and right arm to keep them separate. Since this unit is going \"Cyber\" with the Bluetooth Smart for data tracking, it would have been nice if they added an extra piece of information for the arm/leg being read. But maybe that is overkill. -The reason for only 4 stars instead of five is that the Android or Apple apps do not seem to be ready yet. * The android app does not seem to appear to be on the Google Play store. * The Apple app is on the Apple Store, but after installing it on an iPad, it doesn\'t move past the Terms of Service screen.This is at this point more of an annoyance for \"Rush to Market\" Syndrome. To be fair, their website lists that the product will be available Mid-July, but the devices are on the store shelves already. I will revisit this review once the apps are available.UPDATE 7/16:It appears that the Android app became available in the last day or two.I was able to install it on my Galaxy S4. It does not seem to be production ready yet. Following the directions for pairing devices did not seem to work, i was able to pair/sync after trying some various app/monitor combinations.The data synced from the monitor to the android app. I haven\'t verified the results closely - though at a quick glance - it seems accurate.One thing I noticed is that the \"True Read\" measurements are sent to the app/portal as three separate readings rather than one that is averaged. I consider this to be a bug as it should show the \"True Read\" with some sort of indicator on the app - like it does on the monitor itself.I was not able to sync the \"Person2\" data - though did not spend a lot of time trying...The iOS device still does not work on the iPad.UPDATE: 7/18Discovered the \"Sync\" option by accident while reviewing the data that was sync\'d during the initial pairing. To initiate a sync, you have to \"swipe\" the screen. (Have to love gesture based UIs - but not going there... lol)The csv produced from the website in my opinion is not well thought out for the type of user that probably wants this data. * Why put the \"pulse\" part of the reading on a separate line from the bp reading - shouldn\'t it be just in another column? * The BP is formatted into one column with as \"124 / 65 mmHG\" and pulse has the unit. Makes data formatting a pain. Again - two columns one for Systolic, one for diastolic - and leave out the units.iOS App has an update - it still gets stuck on the Terms and conditions screen (iPad 2)','Hardware seems great so far - but Apps not ready yet...'),(5,'Richard M.','on December 15, 2015','B00KW4PO82',1,'This is a piece of junk, customer service is worthless, and so is the warranty. I bought this from Amazon on September 23, 2015, used it twice a day, and it stopped working less than 3 months later on December 15, 2015. All of a sudden, it would not inflate. The explanation for the error code (E-1) in the user\'s manual is that either the cuff is too loose, the cuff hose is not attached to the unit, or the cuff is leaking. The cuff was definitely not too loose and it was connected to the unit. I tried repeatedly but it would not inflate. I even replaced the batteries and tried it with the AC adapter just to be sure. I even went further and attached a cuff from another brand of monitor that I had in the house, and it worked fine. I went back to the Omron cuff, and it would not inflate. So clearly the cuff was leaking.I called customer support and the agent wanted to try all kinds of things to make sure I wasn\'t doing something wrong. I put the cuff on exactly as he requested and did everything he asked. The unit started to inflate briefly, went up to 5, then back to zero and stopped with an error code E-1. He then wanted me to measure my bicep to make sure it wasn\'t too small (as if it would have shrunk overnight!). He kept insisting that my arm was too small or I was doing something wrong, either not putting the cuff on tight enough or positioning it properly. I made it clear to him that I had been using the unit without a problem for almost three months, twice a day, and that all of a sudden nothing I could do would get it to work. I even told him that when I plugged in the other manufacturer\'s cuff it worked fine. After about 20 minutes of this, he finally gave up and told me that I could send it in if I wished, since it was under warranty, and if (IF!!!) they found it defective they would send me a new cuff. But I would have to pay to package it and send it in, which would be a significant portion of the purchase price, and he could give me no idea how long all this would take. And he said that if there wasn\'t anything wrong with the unit, which he clearly implied was the case, then they would just send the unit back.I\'m just going to use it with the cuff from the other manufacturer until the main unit breaks, which I suspect won\'t take that long. And then I\'ll buy another unit made by anyone but Omron. And I\'ll buy it from a local retailer like Costco which will replace things that break down this quickly.Stay away from Omron!!','and it worked fine. I went back to the Omron cuff'),(6,'Linda','on July 7, 2015','B00KW4PO82',1,'Do yourself a favor and look at other brands. We all self-monitor because we have a BP issue. The unit I purchased is not accurate. The readings are much lower than what my BP really is. I was suspicious of the readings and had my BP taken several times by our local fire department EMT using the same equipment they use when on emergency response calls. I used the Omron before and after the EMT reading over the course of several weeks, at different times of the day to check on its accuracy. On all occasions, the Omron failed miserably to record a BP reading that was even close to the professionally taken BP. I am not able to return this unit through Amazon because the time for return has passed. I contacted Omron directly and told them that the product is defective and that I cannot trust it. I asked them to do the right thing and return my purchase price. From the last response I received from them, I don\'t believe I will receive a refund. Please be careful when deciding on a BP unit since you depend on it for your health and for discussions with your physician. I do not recommend this unit at all.','I do not recommend this unit at all'),(7,'genoa golf','on February 3, 2015','B00KW4PO82',3,'The unit itself is excellent, but the app is not.The unit is very easy to set up for two users, and it has guest mode, too. It holds 100 readings for each of the two users, you switch between users manually - there is a physical switch on the device for that. There is something inside the arm sleeve to make it spring-like and rigid, so it is easy to put it on by yourself. The screen is huge with big bright numbers and is very easy to read. It looks like it is built to last.Unfortunately, to save the readings outside of the device and to email them to your doctor, you need to use an app on a proper tablet. Even so it says it will work with Android 4.3+, it does not work with any of my phones and tablets, the device would not pair and app cannot \"see\" the device; it will only work with Apple iPhone® 5, 5C, 5S; iOS 7+, Samsung Galaxy S® III, Galaxy S® 4; That is it, anything else, and you are out of luck. I called the company, and talked to the tech, and he said they need to write a new app for every different tablet or phone, and it looks like they are not going to make it work with anything that is not new and shiny and very expensive. There is no way to connect the device to a computer and get the data from it. I am very disappointed.Edit: My husband got Samsung Galaxy S5, so we paired the monitor to the phone, and it worked. He emailed me my results, but the email came without attachment. Then I logged in on the omron wellness website, and was able to see all my past results there.

Everything from the packaging to labeling to the Beta Android application were clearly well thought out and, knowing recent readings of my vitals, the results are absolutely accurate. The coolest part is that it is ridiculously easy to sync to your phone, which simultaneously backs it up to your online account. For those worried about your privacy, all they ask for is your email address and a password, so you aren\'t giving away your PCR.The tangible benefit for me is that I can print out my daily history (if I am good about taking my vitals twice a day!), so I can review my health with my primary physician.I have to say, I was hesitant.

An upper arm cuff gives more accurate results than the wrist type, and the flexible cuff as is included in the Omron BP742N 5 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is one of the best home systems I\'ve used. My original was purchased more than a decade ago and it is still functional, but that particular model uses a hard upper arm cuff which I\'ve always found to be a little cumbersome. My most recent purchase at Amazon was the Panasonic EW3109W Portable Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor White/Grey, an item used by home health care providers for my father. They all loved the monitor because it was lightweight and gave clear readings on the large digital display. Costing a little more money, this Omron is a much better device in my opinion. Not only does it maintain readings for two users (in addition to a guest option), but you can obtain an average reading. The cuff is of a high quality, made in Vietnam, and quickly plugs into the machine. Since both have a small adhesive product id label attached, replacement would be easy if ever needed. Because the cuff has a metal rod for adjusting the fit onto the arm, it remains more secure both while being used and while being stored. Included in the package are 4 AA batteries, but there is no power cord which can be purchased separately. For multiple daily use, I\'d suggest getting that accessory. Whereas the Panasonic included a travel sleeve, this one does not. In all honesty, we never used the sleeve. Literature included is in English with a separate copy in Spanish. The quick start guide is in both languages, the style where you flip it over to read it in the language you prefer. As with most products like this, it\'s requested that the consumer phone Omron rather than returning faulty items to the place of purchase.The readings obtained by this monitor have been spot on and the machine is as easy to operate as any other BP monitor for home use I\'ve tried. Being able to clear the memory very simply is a good option, particularly in situations where the users change. A clear physical switch on the bottom of the unit will likely prevent accidental recordings for the wrong memory. I can very highly recommend this blood pressure monitor, particularly in its price range.','One of the best home BP monitor systems I\'ve used'),(14,'M Cox','on July 26, 2014','B00KPQB2NS',5,'Easy to set up and take blood pressure quickly. Although optional, the first thing to do is enter the year, month, day and time of day to record your blood pressure history. There is a selector switch for two users.Taking your blood pressure is simple - just press the start button and wait for your result. You should use the same arm each time, usually the left arm. The blood pressure reading I got was very consistent with recent doctor visits and readings from my existing blood pressure machine. There are two different methods of taking blood pressure. This Omron monitor uses the most conventional method: Pumps up the pressure until well past where the blood flow stops and then takes its measurements as it slowly releases the pressure until all pressure is eventually released. My other brand blood pressure monitor does it the opposite way. It takes its measurements while pumping up the pressure and stops shortly after blood flow cutoff and then quickly releases the pressure - much less painful and dramatically less residual arm ache afterwards.This Omron Blood Pressure monitor stores up to 50 readings for each user and also displays the average if you press the memo key for three seconds. You can also clear all the stored measurements by pressing the memo key and Start/Stop key at the same time for three seconds. It also checks for irregular heartbeat, which I experience periodically. I thought I could always tell if my heart was in fibrillation, but apparently I have gotten used to it and don\'t notice the mild events. So it pays to check my blood pressure more often.Four Duracell AA batteries are included. There is an input for a 6 Volt AC adapter, but it is not included in the box.

It\'s easy to use, and the numbers are large and easily visible. Very happy with this device.My best piece of advice is to make sure that the cuff is the proper size for your arm. This device comes with a cuff meant for arms 9-17 inches around. If your arm is more than 17 inches around, your readings will be falsely high. If your arm is less than 9 inches around, your readings will be falsely low.

This is great for two-person households, where someone may have not have the dexterity or eyesight they once used to have. To use the device out of the box only requires that the batteries be installed, the cuff attached to the base unit, for the cuff to be placed on the upper arm and press the Start button. The screen is large, clear and provides all of the information at a glance. I appreciate that Omron has thought of small details, such as the individual cradles in the battery compartment, which hold each battery perfectly in place. Again, these details make it easy for individuals who no longer have the abilities they may once have had.This unit has a plug for an AC-adapter, but does not include one. It can be ordered off Omron\'s website for half the cost of this monitor (or alternatively, I would probably order a generic DC 6V adapter from elsewhere for a fraction of the cost). An AC-adapter is not required, but it may be nice to have one to keep from replacing batteries. It was very nice that they included Duracell batteries in the box so the device can be used immediately.If you\'re looking at blood pressure monitors, you probably already know why knowing blood pressure is important. High blood pressure is one of the most important indicators of health, usually has no symptoms and only be verified by measurement. This is why even if you are healthy, it is important to know your blood pressure. High blood pressure is one of the best indicators of heart disease, which may lead to heart attacks or strokes. If you have any medical condition or are taking medication, knowing and tracking your blood pressure is very important and it is a good indicator of possible problems. This device (as many Omron devices) includes an irregular heartbeat detector, which is important for individuals with a known history of irregular heartbeats.This may not be the best device money can buy, but it is a solid value and appears to work perfectly with minimal effort.','Refined device that\'s easy for almost anyone to use'),(19,'M.

I have experience with the old, manual type upper-arm sleeves with stethoscope; digital, automatic [no stethoscope] upper-arm sleeves, and this wrist monitor. I even tried the old Omron finger blood pressure monitor many years ago which were reviewed as being inaccurate and which I don\'t think are sold anymore, except there are some cheap knockoffs [non-Omron] still being offered for sale.My primary concern with any blood pressure measuring device is that it be accurate. Convenience is nice, but if it\'s inaccurate then it\'s not very useful, and could even be dangerous if relied upon.I was convinced to try this wrist monitor after reading that it was well-rated by Consumer Reports magazine. I had been put off non-armcuff models after having tried the older Omron finger blood pressure monitor (as described above). While convenience isn\'t paramount to me, I wanted something that was less obtrusive and less noisy that I could use at work; but again, only if it were accurate.The device is well made and convenient to use. It makes some noise, but it is less than the Omron HEM-711 model I was using previously. The noise is mostly from the small cuff inflating, but again, it isn\'t onerous. If it makes any sense, I\'d say the noise is less than half of what the model HEM-711 puts out. There are beeps that tell you if the cuff is positioned correctly and for other user feedback, but they can be disabled if desired.Now for the accuracy part:When I first slapped it on it wasn\'t very accurate. The readings were too low for me. I\'m familiar with my range, and these were about 20 points too low. So, okay, now I was bummed out. But... I still wanted to give it a fair shake remembering that Consumer Reports had given it good marks for accuracy. So I decided to be more rigorous about it.What I did was make sure I was calm and relaxed and then proceeded to do a fairly standardized comparison between my Omron HEM-711 and this new Omron BP652 with several readings and short periods of rest between them. I found that if I used the BP652 correctly that it was accurate. So what did I do? Here\'s how I use it to get the best results:* Mount it correctly on your wrist. It matters that it is aligned with your thumb, as outlined in the manual.* Mount it correctly (part 2): It matters that you avoid that protruding bump from the bone in your wrist, as outlined in the manual. This means you have to mount the device to ride slightly higher on your wrist than you\'d expect. It shouldn\'t be worn as you would a watch or a bracelet. It goes about 1/2\" higher than that. It feels a little funny at first, as if it should be lower, but like I said, this positioning counts.* Set the option for when it starts recording your blood pressure as \"on2\". I won\'t attempt to explain the details of how to configure this setting here, but when you read the instructions it\'ll make sense, and it\'s easy enough to do. Basically, that\'s the setting that makes sure you have it positioned correctly before it takes the blood pressure reading. It\'ll wait until you have it right. The default setting starts taking the reading after a short amount of time even if it isn\'t correctly positioned. I imagine the default setting is meant for certain cases where patients have some kind of mobility impairment, but I don\'t know that for sure.* When it\'s in the right position, move it away from your chest. Don\'t move it up or down, just move it away from your chest so that it isn\'t touching your chest.That\'s it. It seems to have similar readings to my Omron HEM-711. That\'s how to get the best readings from this device, but there are more things you need to do. I\'m listing them separately because some of you know these things already, and they\'re not specific to this device. I\'m listing them just in case it may benefit someone, because we\'re all in this together:* Sit upright without straining. Try not to slouch too much or sit bolt upright.* Keep your feet on the floor not on the footstool.* Don\'t take your blood pressure reading after eating, smoking, or drinking alcohol. Wait at least 30-45 minutes.* Don\'t talk while you\'re taking your blood pressure; it drives it up.* Don\'t hold your breath or breath shallowly while taking your blood pressure thinking that if you stay completely still you\'d get a better reading. Holding your breath or breathing very shallowly will deprive your blood of some oxygen and trigger the brain\'s response to increase your heart rate and thus, your blood pressure. You can breath regularly without negatively affecting your blood pressure.* If you decide to buy a cuff-type monitor make sure that the cuff is around your heart level, too. If it\'s lower the blood pressure readings will be slightly elevated, and if it\'s too high the readings will be slightly too low. This advice is not meant to be taken too rigidly. Just don\'t have the cuff at head level or around your waist and you\'ll be fine.* Don\'t walk around and then sit down and then immediately take your blood pressure. Wait a while for your body to acclimate to sitting and then take the reading.That\'s it. And don\'t forget to take your meds if prescribed to you. : )','Good, if you use it correctly.'),(22,'Nor\'easter','on January 26, 2011','B004D9P1A8',5,'I was very excited to be able to review this product as I have high blood pressure and have searched for years for an easy to use, accurate monitor. Years ago, the best I could find in the marketplace were upper arm, clunky automatic blood pressure monitors that were difficult to use and produced wild, varying results. The Omron Bp652 is an incredible leap forward for accurate and precise home monitoring of one\'s blood pressure via a wrist monitor. I of course need to state at the beginning of this review that if you have hypertension, you need to be under a doctor\'s care and this product does not replace a physician\'s care, however, it is a wonderful tool for monitoring at home how well your meds are , or are not, keeping your blood pressure under control.To test the accuracy of this monitor, I took it with me to my doctor\'s office. My physician measured my bp as 120/81. Minutes later, I used the Omron which gave a measurement of 121/83. That is remarkably close to my physicians bp measurement. Now, I wanted to take a look at how precise the Omron was, i.e. were several measurements taken back to back close? Yes they were! Three back to back measurements by the Omron that night were 116/79, 118/81 and 118/82. Those measurements indicate a high degree of precision. So, in my limited testing that day, the Omron appeared to be exceptionally accurate and precise. I was very impressed.I think the reason for the Omron\'s excellent measurements is in large part due to the superb instructions enclosed with the monitor in conjunction with excellent technology built into the monitor itself. Very good drawings and descriptions are given of how and where to correctly position the monitor on the wrist. Then there is the wonderful Heart Sense technology the Omron employs. For best results, the wrist should be at heart level, or in the \"Heart Zone\". To guide the user to this Zone, the monitor uses a system of orange and blue lights. If the light is orange, you are outside of the Zone and/or are not wearing the monitor correctly and will get an erroneous reading. If the monitor is being worn correctly and the wrist (with monitor) are placed within the Heart Zone, a blue light will come on and the cuff will begin inflating. At the very beginning of using this monitor I had a little bit of trouble finding the right position to wear the cuff on my wrist and I also had problems finding my Heart Zone. But the orange/blue light system led me very quickly to the correct way to wear the monitor and then position my wrist relative to my heart. It was a really interesting experience. When the Omron indicated (by the orange light) that everything was not optimal, I did not receive good readings. But when I got it right and the blue light popped on, the results were stunningly accurate and precise as evidenced by the data I gave earlier. It\'s really a very easy process, dummy proof (I can be one so I should know!) and very fast.I really like this bp monitor and would highly recommend it to anyone with blood pressure issues. High blood pressure is an insidious but serious illness capable of killing over time, and it needs to be monitored. The Omron Bp652 is a wonderful home partner for the control of hypertension. And it also needs to be noted that the Omron will pick up an irregular heart beat and report that to the user- very valuable. Even if the pulse is regular, having the pulse rate measured is very convenient as I also suffer from tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate) so I can do various activities at home and give my doctor feedback on my heart rate.','Excellent, easy to use blood pressure monitor'),(23,'A C Willis','on August 22, 2015','B004D9P1A8',1,'Please note: there are 2 different blood pressure wrist monitors by Omron with item number BP652.

It is reasonably accurate and easier to use compared with a manual blood pressure cuff.The Omron blood pressure monitor is a similar design to the Microlife. They are both wrist monitors that use the oscillometric measuring method. The Omron is more convenient in that it guides the user to the proper arm position. The Microlife requires the user to set the arm in the standard position but does not provide any guidance.The Omron takes measurements from low to high while the Microlife usually takes three measurements and, like most other monitors, goes from high to low. The three measurements are meant to provide a more accurate averaged reading, but it does take over three times as long. The Omron has a feature that automatically averages the last three readings taken within 10 minutes, so it can provide an averaged reading if desired.The low to high measurement is particularly convenient and beneficial. This means there is no delay waiting to inflate the cuff and then waiting for the cuff to deflate while monitoring pulse related pressure changes. For people with elevated blood pressure, this also means no need to have the monitor inflate, waiting for the measurement criteria, and then re-inflating above the original pressure. I am surprised Omron does not highlight this feature more. It really makes this monitor stand out.The Microlife is more sophisticated, has built-in charts, and comes with software and an interface for connecting to the computer. The charts show trends and display more information than the Omron. For some people, this may be helpful, but I prefer the simpler and much faster Omron.','Excellent blood pressure monitor'),(25,'T. S. Ferguson','on April 28, 2011','B004D9P1A8',4,'I ordered this item for my husband, who is a doctor and is developing high blood pressure (figures!). Although he taught me how to take his blood pressure with his professional blood pressure cuff, it is important for him to take it at the same time of day, every day, in order to determine what his \"true\" value is. I got this one for him to try out so he would have something he could use without me having to be around.So this is what we did: for several days, I took his blood pressure with his professional cuff and then we used the Omron wrist unit. It was accurate within 6 points, which, according to my husband, is pretty good. Even re-doing his blood pressure with the professional cuff would cause a fluctuation of 2-4 points.What you get: This blood pressure cuff works on the wrist. You open up the velcro band and place it on your left wrist (take off your watch, move any clothing that may be in the way), and then position the unit over your heart as shown in the diagram. It is fairly idiot-proof, in that if you don\'t have it on correctly, it will give you a \"red/orange\" light, indicating that it is not ready to read. Once you get the \"blue/green\" light, you hit the start button and it starts the squeezing process. It has a two user memory, so two people can use the device and track their blood pressure over time. The only really important part about using this unit is placement. When I was trying it out, I was resting it against my chest (as shown in the diagram) and was getting some pretty wild readings that were inconsistent. It turned out that by touching part of the wrist cuff to my chest, I was actually affecting the reading. You must put it over your heart, but then DO NOT let it touch anything! It must be completely untouched by anything except your wrist (think of your hand in the air, but over your heart). Once I stopped doing that, the readings became more normal and consistent. Also, on a medical note from my husband, it is important that you are consistent in both when and how you take the readings over time.Overall, I gave this a 4 star rating because it isn\'t as good as professional cuff. However, if you need one to use at home that is simple and fairly reliable (which a lot of them aren\'t), this is a good one to buy.','Good home blood pressure unit--directly compared with professional Blood Pressure Cuff'),(26,'Gil Lopez','on March 15, 2015','B004D9P1A8',4,'Well I just recieved mine yesterday, I\'ve taken about 50 readings, all readings relatively close, have taken back to back 3 min interval readings, very close points, really like the memory recall.

You put the unit on your wrist, orienting it as shown in the directions (and a little picture on the unit itself). An orange light comes on; you fold your arm across your chest, and when the correct position is reached, a blue light comes on and the unit begins its operation. It is perhaps twice as fast as the discount-store arm unit that we have, and of course so much smaller and lighter. While I didn\'t benchmark exact readings, the wrist unit and the arm unit generally agree within a few points; since blood pressures vary all the time, I deem the accuracy good, certainly good enough to tell you at once if your blood pressure is too high or perhaps too low.Unlike the arm unit, the wrist unit stores up to 100 readings for each of two people. The only lack here is that the readings, as far as I can tell, can\'t be downloaded to a computer for review and storage. Also, setting the time and date is easy enough but requires removal of the battery cover; I judge this a minor inconvenience as it\'s something you won\'t need to do very often.All of this is great, but even better is that the unit slips virtually unnoticed (in size and weight) in a briefcase or purse, and you can take a reading just about anywhere and everywhere.

My hubby has high blood pressure and I have low blood pressure. Go figure.The Omron has held up well and I like the cuff on it a little better. It\'s a bit more comfortable. However, the unit itself is nearly twice as large as the VIVE which makes it much more bulky to travel with. And, the cuff is even larger than the one that comes with the VIVE which can be challenging for my very small arm. Also, the Omron was nearly three times the price at time of purchase.Looking them over it appears that they do the exact same things. The features are identical which is why I\'m impressed with the VIVE blood pressure monitor. For the price it is a great little unit.It comes with a manual that guides the user in setting up the date, time, and also explains how to set up multiple users and clear the device of all readings. I found it very straight forward and had no difficulty setting up the monitor.This monitor requires four AAA batteries which were included. It has a sensor that will alert you when the batteries are getting low. It appears that you can also use it with a 6 volt AC adapter. We\'re not planning on doing that but it\'s a nice option if you get a low battery warning and don\'t have any handy. No adapter is included just so you know.Everything you need to know to take your blood pressure can be found either on the blood pressure cuff or in the user manual. The manual offers tips for getting the most accurate reading. It also explains how to retrieve the data stored on the monitor. Overall, I found it very helpful.It is possible to set up two users profiles. This monitor allows for storage of 60 readings per user or a total of 120. It will drop off the oldest readings to allow for newer ones to be stored.I compared my readings using both monitors on several occasions. Our Omron has been calibrated at the doctor\'s office so it is quite accurate. The readings on the VIVE were comparable each time.So, it appears that the VIVE is accurate which makes us feel comfortable about switching over or using it as a travel monitor. We WILL take it to our next check-up to have it calibrated as well. This is something that I recommend anyone purchasing a blood pressure monitor do. It\'s very important.I do wish that this monitor came with a storage case. I will probably find something around the house that works for it and if not, it\'ll still easily fit into our toiletry bag when traveling with no problem.I like that this company offers a two year warranty on their products. Hopefully we\'ll never need customer service but still it\'s good to know that the warranty is there.If you are looking for something affordable that is portable and accurate, I recommend checking out this VIVE blood pressure monitor.

I have another blood pressure cuff and used this one and then used my other one (which I know is accurate because I tested that one against my doctors blood pressure cuff) and the readings came out to be the same. So that tells me this Vive blood pressure cuff is just as accurate. The monitor came packaged very nicely with the cuff at the bottom, the box folded in a way to protect the monitor which was on top of the cuff.

The first photo shows the entire content of the package. The monitor itself, the white plastic case for storage of the monitor, instruction manual. The monitor runs on two AAA batteries (included). The battery compartment is shown in photo 3. It has a plastic tongue that goes under the batteries and makes it easy to remove the batteries. The plastic container is very handy, the cuff rolled up and easily fit into the case.The 4h photo shows me taking the measurement. The position of the monitor on your hand as well as position of the hand relative to your heart are very important to get accurate measurements. Once you find the hand position that is comfortable use the same position every day to get measurements that can be accurately compared to each other. The key to home monitoring is to notice a change. If you measure the blood pressure in different position one after another you will notice that the reading are not the same, that\'s why it is important to use the same position every day. The monitor should be at the same level as your heart. The manual shows extending the hand with the monitor in front of you. Another position that works is to place your hand on your chest with monitor at your heart level. I find that putting my hand on my chest is easier, and it gave me the same reading as when extending my hand in front of me.The monitor has two buttons. The one with a circle is that on/off button. As soon as you turn on the monitor it starts measuring. It takes approximately one minute to get a reading. The second button is a memory button which will store the results. The unit has automatic power-off function if you forget to turn it off manually.How to set time? There is a small hole on one the side (the top side if you have the display facing you). Use a small sharp object like a sewing needle to click it. One click puts you into \"adjust time\" mode. Then use the left button (memory) to advance the digits. When the month is set correctly click the hole again to advance to the next number to adjust (days of the months) and so forth. AJThe screen displays your blood pressure and pulse. It also has a low battery indicator.The entire wrist band (measured on the inside) is 11.25\", you need to allow a minimum of 2\" for Velcro closure to secure. That means it can accommodate wrists up to 9.25\" in circumference.I cross-referenced the performance of this wrist monitor with the arm blood pressure cuff I own and they showed fairly close reading. The wrist monitor however was a lot easier to put on, and thus more likely to be used regularly. Measuring Range: Pressure: 30mmHg~280mmHg; Pulse: 40 to 199 times/min; Measuring Accuracy: Pressure: ±3mmHg; Pulse: ±4% of reading.I received Santamedical Wrist Blood pressure Monitor from the manufacture to share my experiences (be it positive or negative) with it with potential future buyers.

I have experience with the old, manual type upper-arm sleeves with stethoscope; digital, automatic [no stethoscope] upper-arm sleeves, and this wrist monitor. I even tried the old Omron finger blood pressure monitor many years ago which were reviewed as being inaccurate and which I don\'t think are sold anymore, except there are some cheap knockoffs [non-Omron] still being offered for sale.My primary concern with any blood pressure measuring device is that it be accurate. Convenience is nice, but if it\'s inaccurate then it\'s not very useful, and could even be dangerous if relied upon.I was convinced to try this wrist monitor after reading that it was well-rated by Consumer Reports magazine. I had been put off non-armcuff models after having tried the older Omron finger blood pressure monitor (as described above). While convenience isn\'t paramount to me, I wanted something that was less obtrusive and less noisy that I could use at work; but again, only if it were accurate.The device is well made and convenient to use. It makes some noise, but it is less than the Omron HEM-711 model I was using previously. The noise is mostly from the small cuff inflating, but again, it isn\'t onerous. If it makes any sense, I\'d say the noise is less than half of what the model HEM-711 puts out. There are beeps that tell you if the cuff is positioned correctly and for other user feedback, but they can be disabled if desired.Now for the accuracy part:When I first slapped it on it wasn\'t very accurate. The readings were too low for me. I\'m familiar with my range, and these were about 20 points too low. So, okay, now I was bummed out. But... I still wanted to give it a fair shake remembering that Consumer Reports had given it good marks for accuracy. So I decided to be more rigorous about it.What I did was make sure I was calm and relaxed and then proceeded to do a fairly standardized comparison between my Omron HEM-711 and this new Omron BP652 with several readings and short periods of rest between them. I found that if I used the BP652 correctly that it was accurate. So what did I do? Here\'s how I use it to get the best results:* Mount it correctly on your wrist. It matters that it is aligned with your thumb, as outlined in the manual.* Mount it correctly (part 2): It matters that you avoid that protruding bump from the bone in your wrist, as outlined in the manual. This means you have to mount the device to ride slightly higher on your wrist than you\'d expect. It shouldn\'t be worn as you would a watch or a bracelet. It goes about 1/2\" higher than that. It feels a little funny at first, as if it should be lower, but like I said, this positioning counts.* Set the option for when it starts recording your blood pressure as \"on2\". I won\'t attempt to explain the details of how to configure this setting here, but when you read the instructions it\'ll make sense, and it\'s easy enough to do. Basically, that\'s the setting that makes sure you have it positioned correctly before it takes the blood pressure reading. It\'ll wait until you have it right. The default setting starts taking the reading after a short amount of time even if it isn\'t correctly positioned. I imagine the default setting is meant for certain cases where patients have some kind of mobility impairment, but I don\'t know that for sure.* When it\'s in the right position, move it away from your chest. Don\'t move it up or down, just move it away from your chest so that it isn\'t touching your chest.That\'s it. It seems to have similar readings to my Omron HEM-711. That\'s how to get the best readings from this device, but there are more things you need to do. I\'m listing them separately because some of you know these things already, and they\'re not specific to this device. I\'m listing them just in case it may benefit someone, because we\'re all in this together:* Sit upright without straining. Try not to slouch too much or sit bolt upright.* Keep your feet on the floor not on the footstool.* Don\'t take your blood pressure reading after eating, smoking, or drinking alcohol. Wait at least 30-45 minutes.* Don\'t talk while you\'re taking your blood pressure; it drives it up.* Don\'t hold your breath or breath shallowly while taking your blood pressure thinking that if you stay completely still you\'d get a better reading. Holding your breath or breathing very shallowly will deprive your blood of some oxygen and trigger the brain\'s response to increase your heart rate and thus, your blood pressure. You can breath regularly without negatively affecting your blood pressure.* If you decide to buy a cuff-type monitor make sure that the cuff is around your heart level, too. If it\'s lower the blood pressure readings will be slightly elevated, and if it\'s too high the readings will be slightly too low. This advice is not meant to be taken too rigidly. Just don\'t have the cuff at head level or around your waist and you\'ll be fine.* Don\'t walk around and then sit down and then immediately take your blood pressure. Wait a while for your body to acclimate to sitting and then take the reading.That\'s it. And don\'t forget to take your meds if prescribed to you. : )','Heathy Watching'),(47,'recluse1','on November 20, 2013','B00ACBKPJ8',5,'i bought this to replce the old wrist monitor that i had used for several years. this is much better design and uses the standard format for detecting blood pressure.. very quick, easy to read, and repeats the same readings every time.

So far, an excellent product.I read other reviews of similar Omron BP meters here and saw all the 1 star reviews. Taking BP is an inherently difficult process. This is because you have to coordinate listening for pulses while reading a pressure meter. Both manually (with a doctor or nurse) as well as automatically (with an automatic meter) have their difficulties. I\'ve found that all forms of BP measurement can seem inaccurate so careful cuff positioning and technique can be paramount.I would never change my medication based mainly on readings from an automatic BP meter or even one persons BP measurements - it\'s just too easy to get it wrong.

Nye','on August 3, 2014','B00KPQB2SS',4,'As a physician I treat many patients who have hypertension. One of the inherent problems with assessing blood pressure in the office setting is many people are nervous and anxious which leads to higher blood pressure readings in the office than they might normally have in their normal environment at home. Since I encourage my patients with hypertension to buy a blood pressure meter so they can monitor their blood pressure at home I was happy to have an opportunity to assess this Omnron BP785N 10 Series meter.The meter arrives in a box that is easy to open. Included with the meter is a removable arm cuff and an AC adapter. The AC adapter is very lightweight and can be easily overlooked when opening the packaging unless you look for it. There is no carry case included for this product. There is an included quick start guide and a comprehensive owner\'s manual that come with the package.This particular meter can be operated with four AA batteries (not included) or the included AC adapter. You can set the meter for time and date. This is handy as the meter can store up to 100 blood pressure readings each for two different people and include time/date information to see how blood pressure varies over time. You need to install batteries, though, to retain time/date information, so even if you plan to use the meter off AC it is still recommended to install batteries in the unit. The meter is very simple to operate. You simply slip on the cuff and press the start button. The meter will automatically inflate the cuff and record both blood pressure and pulse rate information. The memory storage on the meter allows you to compare current blood pressure with previous readings. There is a \"guest\" function so a third person can check blood pressure without interfering with stored readings.One thing that sets this meter apart from others I have used is the cuff is designed to easily wrap around your arm without having to worry about correctly fastening it. Unlike other brands, this Omron cuff is very easy to put on and take off. It will fit arms from 9-17 inches in diameter, which means it will work for both average-sized and heavier adults.Another nice feature to this meter is it can be configured to record three separate blood pressure readings, each up to 60 seconds apart, and then average them for a more accurate blood pressure assessment. All information is stored in memory, so you can view the averages and the individual readings.I like the fact that this meter can be operated with an AC adapter. This helps eliminate inaccuracy from worn batteries and makes the meter more versatile.Overall, this is a very good blood pressure meter for the money spent. It is easy to use, works quickly and accurately, and stores a large number of blood pressure readings for up to two different people for later review. The only downside to this particular product is it does not come with a carry case. But if you are looking for a good quality blood pressure meter than can be operated with batteries or AC power the Omron BP785N 10 Series is a very good one to consider.','works well; AC adapter included; no carry case'),(64,'delicateflower152','on July 25, 2014','B00KPQB2SS',5,'If you or someone you love are at that stage of life when taking your blood pressure is a necessity, the “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” may be exactly what you need. It is easy to set up; easy to use; has an easy to see display; and keeps a record of the readings for two individuals. However the description is incorrect, the monitor does not have Blue Tooth capability.Knowing the majority of purchasers might be senior citizens, Omron has thoughtfully designed this monitor. Its Quick Start Guide is printed in larger, bold letters – approximately 1/8” – 3/16” high. This makes that guide quite useful for individuals who have impaired vision. (The more detailed instruction book is printed using larger type for the basic instruction and standard sized type for more detailed information regarding the instruction.) The digits shown on the backlit monitor are approximately ¾” high; even when one is not wearing their glasses, the size of the display makes the readout very visible.Including four AA batteries, the wedge-shaped base weighs only 17.6 ounces; its footprint is about 4” X 6”. The partially rigid, curved cuff of the “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” fits around the user’s upper arm. This makes the 5 5/8” long cuff very easy to use correctly. I am a petite individual and the cuff fit me correctly. Arthritic users or those individuals who may have impaired hand function will find the unit’s weight and the cuff design/construction very desirable features.The “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” also includes an AC adapter. If the monitor is used at bedside, the ability to plug it in is a nice feature since one does not have to insert batteries in order to operate the unit. The air jack and air plug are both blue; this makes the connection site easy to locate and use correctly.The monitor can record up to 100 blood pressure readings each for two individuals; this equals the 200 readings the description says this unit can hold. Further, the TruRead Mode feature of the “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” allows you to take three readings in immediate succession; the user can adjust the time between these readings from 15 seconds to 30 seconds to 1 or two minutes.I found the blood pressure readings taken on the “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” consistent with those taken at my physician’s office. They were significantly more consistent and accurate than those of the wrist-style blood pressure monitor I own.The “Omron BP785N10 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor” is a fine choice for at-home monitoring of one’s blood pressure.

I\'ve had a number of Omron and Panasonic BP monitors over the years, and this compares favorably to them. There are fewer buttons than on previous models, which may appeal to those looking for simplicity. In order to take your blood pressure, you put on the cuff, then press a single button, which turns on the machine and starts getting a reading right away. The downside to this approach is that to get another reading, you have to turn the machine off, then on again. Also, it is a little more complicated to use the more advanced functions, since there aren\'t many buttons, and they aren\'t labeled with text.The large LED is very easy to read, even in bright lighting. The cuff fits most average adult upper arms, although it is a little stiffer than I\'m used to. You can buy a number of add-ons if desired, including different size cuffs for larger or smaller arm sizes.I took one star off for a couple of issues:1. There is no storage case (some earlier Omron monitors included this).2. The cuff isn\'t clearly labeled to show how to align it on your arm (i.e. where it should go over your artery).Other than these, the monitor does a very good job of doing its basic task, which is to get accurate blood pressure readings.

However, there are a few things I prefer about the Panasonic monitor. - The Panasonic cuff to be much more comfortable. It is a wraparound style while the Omron has you put your arm through a close loop and then pull to tighten. On paper that sounds easier and in practice I found somewhat cumbersome. - The Omron monitor cuff inflated more quickly. However, it inflated \"more\" resulting in a bit more pressure on my arm. If I were the sensitive sort (as opposed to a stoic man\'s man), I might have found it uncomfortable. In addition, it takes longer to deflate resulting in reading taking about as long. - The Omron is a bit noisier. - The Panasonic monitor fits inside the rolled cuff when not in use. The result is a smaller \"package\" that is easier to store. - Perhaps the biggest benefit with the Panasonic is that it provides the average of all stored values. One use for that is to just collect measurements over a long time and see what happens to the average. Another, and I feel better, use is to start with a clear memory, take three readings in succession, and record the average. That is, in fact, a built-in capability in the more expensive Omron monitors.Bottom line: Either does a good job and I like the&nbsp;<a class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Panasonic-monitor/dp/B000NY6JXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Panasonic monitor</a>&nbsp;better.

The first was a Panasonic which I liked, except the cuff was a bit snug (I was on the cusp of needing an XL cuff, according to Panny’s product specs), and it was reasonably accurate, but very sensitive, so the slightest misalignment and I ended up with BP readings all over the place. I ended up returning it, more due to the cuff than the cuff than the readings (I would have needed to buy a larger cuff).My current monitor is a MicroLife. That monitor is about as accurate as the Panasonic was, but less sensitive. It also had an AC adapter, as well a carrying case. I think both are decent monitors. I wanted to have a second monitor for comparison, should I get a very high reading.I just got the Omron 3 series, BP710. It includes the unit itself, a standard cuff, quick start guide and an instruction manual.The monitor seems accurate, when tested against my MicroLife unit, and/or a same-day visit to the doctor. Like the Panasonic, the cuff range is just under my arm size (9” to 17”). My arm is a tad over 17” where the cuff goes. I find the BP710 simple to use, with an easy to read display. It lacks a “two user” mode, which I find to be a nice feature, one available on my other monitor.The BP710 runs on four AA batteries (NOT included).The unit comes with a 2 year warranty. It is made in Viet Nam.Every one of these units, from every maker, has their own specific instruction for use. On some you have to align a mark on the cuff with your pinky on your left arm, on the BP710 it happens to be aligning an arrow on the cuff with your middle finger. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the most accurate results. I find the BP710 provides generally relaiable readings. Every once in a while I get a crazy one and need to make sure I lined up everything and then re-take it.....either that or I\'m already dead. But that happens on just about all these home units, if you move, have the cuff on wrong, not lined up with your finger, etc. The BP710 does have an alert if you cause an error by movement.If you need an inexpensive, lightweight, easy-to-use blood pressure monitor, the BP710 is a good option.

I haven\'t tested myself often before having this monitor but I have used the one that my in laws have. As far as I can tell, the readings I have gotten for my BP and pulse is right in line with their more expensive device. If you want an easy way to keep an eye on your BP and pulse, this monitor is an inexpensive option and will help you with getting in touch with your heart\'s health. It can\'t hurt to be on top of this kind of thing- it\'s always a good idea to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our overall health. I\'ve been using this device multiple times a day for over a week and have been very impressed with how well it works, I\'d recommend it to others who are interested in tracking their own heart and blood pressure. It\'s affordable and works! * I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

This blood pressure monitor is fairly accurate if used correctly. My wife is a nurse and took my blood pressure the old fashion way which is the most accurate way and then I used this device after and it was pretty spot on. I also conducted a few tests just to see if it would read the changes in my body. I did some jumping jacks and then used this to check my heart rate, it read a higher heart rate so that was good. During Christmas my family and I were drinking (a lot of alcohol) and for fun we decided to use this monitor. What I learned is when I drink (a lot) my heart rate is elevated. What I also learned is that my sister in law should probably go to the doctors because her blood pressure is higher than normal (she was not drinking). Overall I love using this blood pressure monitor. Even though I got this at a discounted rate, I would gladly pay full price to have this in my house. I know its not a toy, but it\'s just fun knowing how your blood pressure is doing and since its so easy to use (wrap it around your wrist and push a button) you can easily get carried away checking it multiple times a day.

Well, the reason I did was because a friend\'s BP monitor gave me some readings that I really didn\'t like, especially since I got a really good reading at the Dr\'s office a few months prior. Pros: This unit is really easy to use. You just wrap it around your wrist and hit one button. It takes the measurement fairly quickly and isn\'t too loud. I don\'t find it uncomfortable, but my wife thought it got too tight. It includes the batteries! It does keep history of your past readings that you can cycle through. It comes with its own storage bag.Cons: The buttons on the front are very easy to hit accidentally (like when putting it away in the storage bag) Then it starts taking a measurement and you have to dig back in the bag to turn it off. (I would suggest they make it activate after a 1.5 second button press.) Not a huge deal, but annoying. The biggest con, is that it appears to be a bit off in accuracy. (It reads a bit on the high side. I checked it compared to what was taken at my dr office a few minutes later and the systolic value (top number) was about 15-18 too high, but the diastolic was right on. The velcro that holds the strap may not stand the test of time. As long as I make sure it is secure, it appears to hold pretty good, but I feel like it needs to hold a little stonger. I am kinda worried that it might lose strength over time.Advice: read the directions and follow them exactly. I cant speak to what affect eating and having a full bladder have on readings, but you MUST have your arm level with your heart when taking a measurement. Before I followed that step, I was getting readings that were 50 points above normal. I was ready to head into my Dr office and start to freak out.

Stiles','on March 29, 2016','B01AV79MN2',5,'My husband suggested I get this because I needed a way to check my heart rate. I can\'t afford a fitbit right now. I\'d had a blood pressure cuff several years ago and never replaced it when it finally broke. One major thing I liked about this is that it goes around the wrist. I have flabby upper arms and when a regular cuff is used it hurts so much I get sick to my stomach. My orthopedic office uses a wrist cuff and informed me I could purchase my own so I did some searching. This one had a lot of favorable reviews and was definitely in my price range. I purchased it and have been happy ever since. I set it up which was easy. Then to try it out, I put it on, got on my recumbent bike, and got my heartrate up As soon as i stopped I hit the on button and waited just a few seconds. I had a reading for my heartrate. My blood pressure showed it was up a little bit and I thought it was due to the exercise. I got up the next morning and took my blood pressure just to get a base line and saw it was elevated. I immediately thought maybe it was the machine. Here is the funny thing, I had a doctor\'s appointment and the measurement was accurate. I did this each morning last week, with Tuesday being the only day I had no doctor\'s appoint. Friday\'s appt. was a visit with a cardiologist for clearance for surgery and when she told me my blood pressure, I looked at what I\'d written down and realized how accurate the machine was. Those readings along with my EKG reading has prompted further testing. This may not sound like much, but I\'ve always had very low blood pressure and this was an indication that something was going on. So here I am the following week thinking that it was up due to stress over all of those doctor visits and it is still hanging up around the same reading. I feel much better knowing that what I am reading is as accurate as the doctor\'s office no matter if they use a regular cuff or a wrist cuff. I\'ve already told several teachers at school about it. It is accurate and cost effective. What more could you ask for?','Accurate and Cost Effective'),(88,'Brad Burke','on April 20, 2016','B01AV79MN2',3,'This unit works well around 90% of the time.

His nurse took my pressure when I first got there using the traditional cuff and stethoscope. She read a very high reading. My doctor came in and saw the high number and asked if she used the right sized cuff. I had no idea there were different sizes. Sure enough, she used the one she uses on all patients which was too small for me. There are markings on the inside of the cuff to let you know if it is the right size or not as you wrap it. He then used the correct size on me and got a very different reading! Go figure! I then compared his new reading to this unit and they were within 10 digits for the Sys and within 15 for DIa. That doesn\'t mean this unit is not accurate since this second reading was off about the same amount from his first.

Other devices first inflate the cuff above the estimated systolic BP (the upper number) and THEN listen for sounds from the arterial blood vessels. If a sound is heard, it means that there is insufficient inflation of the cuff and the cuff pressure is further increased. Once the pressure is above the systolic BP the device slowly deflates the cuff while first listening for the blood to begin flowing (it makes a \'swishing\' sound); this is the systolic BP. The pressure is further lowered until no sound is heard. This is the diastolic or bottom BP number. This takes time, excessive arm pressure and can be uncomfortable for may people.In contrast, the EW3109W listens to the arterial blood vessel sound while INFLATING the cuff. In this manner, the diastolic BP is heard first. The pressure continues to increase in the cuff until no sound is heard, indicating the systolic BP. Then the pressure in the cuff is rapidly lowered and the measurement is complete. Thus, only one inflation/deflation cycle is required and the inflation pressure is NEVER significantly above the systolic pressure. The measurement is fast since the pressure and blood vessel sounds only need to be measured once. The short cycle with cuff pressure never significantly in excess of your BP. This is what makes using the device comfortable.As a \'heart\' patient, accuracy and repeatability are very important. As for the accuracy, I have tested the device against my own conventional/manual BP cuff. Further, I have taken the device to be compared to my physicians measurements. In both cases, there was a very close correlation. As for the repeatability, I typically take my BP 3 times over a 5 min. period. The measurements are always very similar.Like all automatic BP devices, the EW3109W is easy to use. Unlike other devices, the EW3109W is inexpensive!(FYI, I have been a medical device researcher and developer for over 30 years)','Excellent automatic blood pressure cuff'),(92,'Andrea Polk','on July 3, 2010','B000NY6JXA',5,'Looking to replace an automatic cuff of another brand, which after years of solid service had died, I found this Panasonic automatic blood pressure cuff. Having priced them at local stores I found the price at under forty to be exceptional for a cuff that would fit both my arm (12\") and my husband\'s arm (16\"). I took a chance and ordered it off Amazon and am so happy with my purchase!The cuff is already in a semi-contoured tube (no flopping around), so sliding your arm into it is very easy. Placing the cuff so that the line from the unit to the cuff runs like a straight line to your pinky finger is one of the only things you really have to pay attention to for an accurate reading. The other things are not to take your blood pressure right after eating (a universal rule of thumb), have your arm approximately at the same height (on a table next to you) as your heart when taking your blood pressure reading, and take one reading, not multiple readings one after the other, for the best results.Securing the cuff with the velcro closure is very easy, but don\'t put it on too tightly. Once you push the button to start the test, the cuff gets quite tight, and may even feel uncomfortable, but it\'s only for a very short while. The entire testing process takes no more than 30 seconds. My last reading took 13 seconds.The readout is large enough to easily see it, despite the unit itself being surprisingly small.

If your BP is high, then it inflates to ~200mmHg for a higher BP reading. What this ends up doing is causing undue discomfort to the patient. And if you have thin skin, you are at risk for skin damage, bleeding, bruising, etc. This monitor completely fixes this problem by taking your blood pressure in an ascending fashion instead of descending. So while it\'s pumping up, it\'s listening for your diastolic and systolic sounds, and it doesn\'t pump up higher than it needs to. Truly, this is the best portable BP monitor I\'ve ever seen and used. The geniuses at Panasonic really deserve a nod for this technique. It\'s going to save a lot of undue discomfort for many people.

Its Quick Start Guide is printed in larger, bold letters – approximately 1/8” – 3/16” high. This makes that guide quite useful for individuals who have impaired vision. (The more detailed instruction book is printed using larger type for the basic instruction and standard sized type for more detailed information regarding the instruction.)Including the four AA Duracell batteries that were packaged with this monitor, the wedge-shaped base weighs only 17.1 ounces; its footprint is about 4” X 6”.

Truthfully though, because of where I place the monitor on my desk, another electric cord would just be one more thing to have to untangle. I suppose it would be helpful for times the batteries run out. (Or I may change my mind if the batteries run out quickly, but haven\'t had it long enough to see how long they last),I\'d buy it again, and am seriously considering buying one as a gift for a family member.Edit Dec 2015 - it is still working well. I was worried at one point that it might be giving my spuriously low values, because my doctor\'s office always gets significantly higher readings. So I took my monitor to an appointment with me one day and we compared them side by side and they correlated, so yes I have \"white coat syndrome\". The practitioner was satisfied that my home readings were good.

We purchased the Omron BP760N model at the local medical supply store on the recommendation of the store owner. Later that day, my wife took it with her to her doctor\'s office, where the readings compared closely enough to the doctor\'s BP monitor.The Comfit cuff is a unique design that makes it very easy for a person to take their own blood pressure. It\'s actually the most hassle-free BP cuff that I\'ve used, both for putting it on and getting the sensor in the correct location over the brachial artery. Also, the ability to store and recall results for two different users is a very handy feature. Note that the monitor, in addition to displaying the systolic and diastolic numbers, uses color-coded lights to indicate if the BP is in the normal range (green) or outside the normal range (orange). By definition, the monitor uses 135/85 as normal blood pressure. The monitor will also alert the user if it detects an irregular heartbeat rhythm.','Reliable and simple to use'),(108,'Mark','on December 6, 2015','B00KPQB4OU',2,'Beware, the Omron 7 Series Model BP760N does NOT have the following feature which this web pages says it has:\"Automatically takes 3 consecutive readings one minute apart and displays the average, following guidelines set by the American Heart Association\".

I was advised by my physician to get an Omron automatic pressure cuff reader for their accuracy.

Nye','on August 3, 2014','B00KPQB4OU',4,'As a physician I treat many patients who have hypertension. One of the inherent problems with assessing blood pressure in the office setting is many people are nervous and anxious which leads to higher blood pressure readings in the office than they might normally have in their usual environment at home. Since I encourage my patients with hypertension to buy a blood pressure meter so they can monitor their blood pressure at home I was happy to have an opportunity to assess this Omnron BP760N 7 Series meter.The meter arrives in a box that is easy to open. Included with the meter is a removable arm cuff and four Duracell AA batteries. There is no carry case included for this product. There is an included quick start guide and a comprehensive owner\'s manual that come with the package.After installing the batteries you can set the meter for time and date. This is handy as the meter can store up to 60 blood pressure readings each for two different people and include time/date information to see how blood pressure varies over time. The meter is very simple to operate. You simply slip on the cuff and press the start button. The meter will automatically inflate the cuff and record both blood pressure and pulse rate information. The memory storage on the meter allows you to compare current blood pressure with previous readings. There is a \"guest\" function so a third person can check blood pressure without interfering with stored readings.One thing that sets this meter apart from others I have used is the cuff is designed to easily wrap around your arm without having to worry about correctly fastening it. Unlike other brands, this Omron cuff is very easy to put on and take off. It will fit arms from 9-17 inches in diameter, which means it will work for both average-sized and heavier adults.Overall, this is a very good blood pressure meter for the money spent. It is easy to use, works quickly and accurately, and stores a large number of blood pressure readings for up to two different people for later review. The downsides to this particular product is it does not have an AC adapter nor does it come with a carry case. But if you are looking for a good quality battery-operated blood pressure meter the Omron BP760N 7 Series is a very good one to consider.','easy to use; works well; no AC adapter or carry case'),(111,'Tariq Gibran Hamid','on May 15, 2014','B00H43WOAK',4,'This is a pretty impressive monitor. It\'s well made, comfortable, easy to carry/ transport and use anywhere. Once set up, it\'s very easy to use and, I\'m discovering, is able to make it\'s readings available to other apps such as IBP Blood Pressure monitor. The main reason I purchased this was to have a way to automatically keep track of my readings and this device completely solves that nuisance.I think the device itself is a solid 5-star product but the software is still a work in progress. The main negative is on the Withings software side. Some of the web interface is in a beta state so making the readings available to other Apps may seem cumbersome initially as you must first set up an account to use the device (which can be done directly within the app on one\'s phone) but you then must sign in on the website and find the option to \"share\" the readings with other software. The Android app on the phone itself has crashed on me a number of times as well. Furthermore, Withings has not updated their iPad software and I am unable to load their Health Mate App on my iPad Air, even though I can find it if searching for iPhone only. If you are an iPad Air user, that\'s a big fail so my advice is to wait for the software to be updated unless you are also using an iPhone or Android phone. So, on my iPad air, the only access I have to the blood pressure readings is through a third party app - IBP - after setting up the sharing option mentioned above.Overall, a great device somewhat let down by the software options.

I received no notification regarding any defect via mail, email or phone and admittedly used the cuff every now and then. So, I was asked to return the cuff so they can review and inspect, expecting a replacement of my ~$130 cuff. They offered me a 25% discount code on new cuff purchased from their store. Whah? I want my cuff back and they say by sending it to them I agreed to the discount which I did not. For $130, I\'d rather figure out how to fix the so-called hardware defect than give it away for $32.50 to be refurbished or whatever they plan to do with it.

Unfortunately, their support is limited with just web form and they take a long time to respond. There is no phone number I was able to find. I\'ve had stellar customer service with them with a previously defective cuff that would not be recognized by my iPhone as an early adopter so I was quite shocked by this customer experience. The product was not reliable but bearable with intermittent at best readings when I used and with as many players (competition) in the field slightly overpriced IMHO. Given the ratings on the other products I was considering Pulse o2 and Aura which seems to be buggy and limited based on feedback with many consistent comments about the the dismal customer service (gone down over the years), I\'d rather spend my money elsewhere (i.e. Fitbit and Philips for the morning light).','Hardware Defect acknowledged by Manufacturer'),(113,'Former Tanker','on October 10, 2014','B00H43WOAK',1,'Product sucks, interface sucks, customer support would suck if it existed.

This is after a lifetime of having perfect blood pressure (and I am in the best physical shape of my life).I had been planning for quite some time to purchase one of these wireless blood pressure monitors and was keeping an eye on the reviews for the Qardio brand that is also sold on Amazon. However, after all the negative reviews over hardware and sync failures with that brand, I knew I had to look at something else. Actually, what finally drove me to Withings was the 5-star reviews of its app on the iTunes store. There\'s nothing worse than a strong product that comes with a lousy iOS/Android app. Fortunately, Withings comes through with flying colors in both departments.Out of box, setup was easy. With batteries already loaded, I simply hit the bluetooth button on the cuff and paired it with my Apple phone. I would recommend that purchasers install the app first, launch it, and have it walk you through the process.I would also recommend that before you hit the START button on the app and take your first reading, to click on the settings icon on the upper corner of the app and have it automatically take three readings to average out your readings.I was pleasantly surprised, using the enclosed instruction booklet, how easy it is to place this cuff above the elbow, wrap, and take a reading. It\'s really effortless. The results are not only sent to my iOS device, but readings are logged within the app and can easily be shared or emailed to my physician.Have not had to change the batteries yet, so I don\'t know how difficult that process will be. There is a screw at the bottom of the cuff tube to access the batteries, though I am concerned about it becoming stripped over time. I would be very, very gentle with any coin used to open it.I also, at the time of purchase of this Blood Pressure monitor, put the Withings Body Scale in my cart. At the last minute, I removed it due to a few negative reviews and the mention that there is no customer support from this company. That is concerning.

The buttons have different purposes based on which mode you\'re in. E.g. when setting the time the \'transfer\' button (2nd button from the right top) doubles as the increment button. Sadly, when setting the time/date, there\'s only an increment button, no decrement button. Which means if you hit the button one too many times (like I did) you have to cycle through the numbers all over again. I had a tough time setting the date to 2015 (which was the default by the way). I just accidentally hit the transfer button and it went to 2016 and from there on it took me a number of tries to figure out that it wraps at year 2045.

It\'s basing it\'s decision on the inclination of the monitor (so it\'s making assumptions). But if you use the product as described, these are good assumptions and work well. When the unit is happy that your wrist is level with your heart, it automatically starts taking the reading. And the readings seems pretty consistent.I also tried pairing this device with my Android phone (requires creating an Omron account). The pairing is done via bluetooth and it worked well enough. You can transfer the readings from the unit to the phone and it displays it nicely in a graph (over days, weeks or months how your pressure changes). The only problem is that it assumes only person is using the monitor. So the readings cannot be split up for person 1 or person 2, etc. It assumes just one person. That part I don\'t like (suggestion for impovement to Omron).Overall this is a pretty good blood pressure monitoring unit. And I would recommend trying it out.','Only tracks 1 person, consistent readings'),(134,'netscorer','on September 30, 2015','B010H76PTU',3,'Very difficult to connect to the smartphone.

My boyfriend then took his, and same thing, his pressure was up. We pulled out the portable blood pressure machine we have and compared - the portable (upper arm type) machine showed our pressures to be lower. We then moved the wrist monitor lower on our wrist and that was the problem -- though the picture shows to place the wrist monitor just under the protruding wrist bone by an inch or so, actually, at least in our experience, it needs to be a bit lower than that to accurately read.Once we figured that out, this blood pressure monitor worked great. It\'ll be a nice portable one for my guy to use since he takes BP meds and should monitor his pressure more frequently. I would use it for when I want to check to see if mine is very low and would effect/affect my workout routine.But, as for the APP - I haven\'t downloaded it yet to receive the full experience of this monitor because it received so many bad reviews - mainly, they say, after the recent update.

On one arm, the Ozeri indicated a systolic BP that was 13 mmHg below the systolic reading from the doctor\'s cuff, and the diastolic reading was 3 mmHg higher. On the other arm, my systolic result was 15 mmHg lower than the doctor\'s, and the diastolic was the same. I have 39 measures saved in the Ozeri - 9 of them indicated that my BP was too low (sometimes the systolic, sometimes the diastolic, and sometimes both).

I was very impressed with this level of customer service, and took them up on it. I am very sorry to say that the replacement also did not match the values from a doctor\'s office. It took some time before I was at the doctor\'s again, so it took a while for me to do this checking. I decided that I should double-check by matching it against a different doctor/clinic reading, which took more time. Again, it did not match. I don\'t remember the exact numbers, but had the difference been small I might have wanted to continue using this product. It is now a year and a half since I ordered the original, and today I am returning both.

I was dazzled by Ozeri\'s multi-colored readout, so I ordered it. As it turned out, it was one of the worst BP units I have ever used.First, it never was able to take a complete reading without an error message or failing to inflate. The instruction were very clear, and I followed them exactly. Usually after five of six tries, I would finally get one reading. This is unacceptable, and one of my family members commented that the Ozeri was probably raising my blood pressure because of its ineffectiveness.I couldn\'t agree more.The colored LED display is really nice and cool, but if the machine can\'t even take a reading on the first try, it fails in its purpose. The Ozeri doesn\'t have an audible or visual signal to tell you when your arm is in the proper position for a reading, so you have to do the best you can from the illustration in the manual (your arm should approximately be at heart level). A table or flat surface is needed use Ozeri, and even so, the unit still failed again and again.I have returned this unit to Amazon, and its great return policy has saved the day again. I realize that this may have been a bad unit, but even so, the inconvenience of not having a position alert, and the necessity of having to have a table to place your arm on is a lot of hassle.I have opted for the Omron 7, and this unit is a wonder. It did everything well the first time I used it, and it is very easy to use and has a position alert, which is invaluable.It\'s too bad Ozeri failed, I would have liked keep it. But considering the circumstances, I have returned it.','Consistently failed to take BP readings'),(161,'J. Peterson','on April 10, 2011','B004H44GB4',4,'I\'ve owned/used several other blood pressure meters over the years, including ones from Omron and LifeSource. The older units look pretty basic compared to this latest Omron, which provides significant more computerized functionality than the older units. However, this does come at the cost of greater complexity.Good things about the new Omron:* \"TruRead\" mode, which automatically takes 3 sequential readings and averages them. I always did this manually with my older units anyway because the readings would differ slightly from time to time, but this one does it with one touch of a button, and then computes the average for you.* Cuff is very nice: broad and stiff, which I find much easier to apply.* Automatically determines if you have applied the cuff correctly.* Like a dozen other things I own these days, this unit can connect to my computer via USB, which fortunately is by the common \"mini\" USB connector and not the less common \"micro\" USB connector, which means that you can use the same USB cord as you use for many other devices.Things that may or may not be good:* It is set up to handle 2 regular users, via an A/B slide switch. This really is only useful if you have 2 people who both use the same unit regularly, and they both want to have the unit keep track of averages and/or download readings to a computer. Of course, you have to remember to set the switch in the right position for you so you don\'t get mixed up, which would destroy the value of any history.* You can connect it to your Windows computer as mentioned above, supposedly to connect to Microsoft Health Vault (which I did not try - who wants to upload their personal information to something run by Microsoft?) or to Omron\'s Health Management software package which you can download and run privately on your own Windows PC. I did try out the latter, which does allow you to upload stored readings to your computer for graphing of historical trends. I find this only marginally useful if at all - I do keep my own log in Excel, where I can also add notes, add other data, and analyze and graph it myself - all without having to plug it in to my computer. I did experience some difficulty uploading, where it was not obvious what to do to start the upload after connecting the unit to my computer.Things that are not so good:* It has various computational abilities such as a memory, ability to keep history for morning &amp; evening readings, etc. I suppose this could provide some value to those who are tech-oriented and would value the additional information, but I find that it just adds unnecessary complexity to the device with little value to me. I found it difficult to figure out how to make this work, even after (re)reading the instruction manual several times. Anything that requires you to keep the instruction manual handy flunks my usability test, and likely will not be used by 98% of most users. Factoid to provide contrast: My old LifeSource unit had just 1 button, my old Omron had just 2, while this unit has 7 buttons.Overall, I like the unit because it is a useful improvement over my older devices, particularly due to the useful TruRead feature. It does provide PC connectivity and more computational features that older units too, but not everyone will find those capabilities useful, and they do increase the complexity of the unit.UPDATE 12/23/11 - Long-term experience report:The unit is still working well, and I like it. The good features I mentioned above, especially the TruRead feature, have turned out to be real advantages over previous units, and I would really miss them if I had to go back.For anything other than very occasional use, you *will* need to run this unit plugged into the power adapter (included), because it consumes batteries more rapidly than older units, perhaps because of the TruRead feature.

And more complex'),(162,'Phyllis Staff','on March 23, 2011','B004H44GB4',5,'For five years, I used my Omron monitor to check my mother\'s blood pressure, morning and evening. She suffered from Alzheimer\'s disease and had two strokes, so it was important that I get accurate readings and get them consistently. Omron did the job! Now I\'ve got a new monitor, and it\'s even better than the old reliable one.Here\'s my take on this new Omron monitor:PROS:1. This new monitor is powered by battery or ac adapter. The unit comes complete with adapter, so you don\'t have to miss a reading while you purchase new batteries. Lithium batteries are recommended, but I\'m trying out rechargeable batteries.2. My old monitor had a memory function for the last three readings, but this new one remembers readings for an entire week. In addition, its memory distinguishes between morning and evening readings.3. The product description calls this unit \"Large.\" However, the cuff has velcro strip adjustments for both regular and large arms.4. The cuff on this new monitor has an circular insert that helps you get the cuff on with less difficulty than the older cuff. It\'s sturdy but not rigid, so it will fit almost any adult arm.5. Here\'s the thing I like best -- the readout unit is stand-alone. I always dropped the small readout unit with my old machine, but this new one can sit on a nearby table or chair seat without the danger of drops -- a BIG improvement!6. Omron has its own software that you can download and install for free. You attach the unit to your computer with the included cable, and you\'re ready to upload your data. Since I had to purchase a program to keep records for my mother, I find this a money-saving opportunity for people who must keep records for a long time. I have installed and used the software with no problems.CONS:This is a larger unit than my previous Omron, so my old case (padded and stiff) is too small for this unit. This new fabric case does not afford the same degree of protection for the unit.OVERALL:My years of experience with Omron had already convinced me of the reliability of Omron products. This new monitor has added features that make it even better than my old unit.Thanks, Omron!','Even Better than the Omron Monitor I\'ve Used for Five Years'),(163,'Bill S','on January 19, 2012','B004H44GB4',1,'I thought I was buying a top of the line replacement for my old Omron BP monitor which finally stopped working after 10 years. Right out of the box I noticed the new monitor was reading 12 to 20 points higher than my typical blood pressure for both diastolic and systolic. At first I thought my blood pressured suddenly increased until I checked it at an in-store BP monitor. I tried different cuff angles, sitting positions and the unit continued to read high. I finally took it with me to my doctor\'s appointment and both the nurse and doctor confirmed it was reading high. The error was also inconsistent. I called Omron\'s customer service and their basic attitude was that each monitor is checked before it\'s shipped and that I\'m probably using it wrong. I confirmed that my arm size was well within the range of the universal cuff that comes with the unit. I also went thru the method and technique used to take the readings - cuff position, arm elevation, proper seated position - all per their user directions. They were more interested in defending their product than listening to all the ways I tried achieve an accurate reading as well as my doctors results. I\'ve been monitoring my BP for over thirty years, starting with manual hand operated cuff pump units and a stethoscope. The call ended with the rep saying you can ship the unit to us, but we will more than likely find that it is calibrated correctly and you will receive the same unit back (at my shipping expense)! Beware, Omron\'s warranty does cover not shipping. After the call, I read more Amazon reviews and found others with similar problems with this model.

If the alignment of the cuff is off, so is the measurement. Its a real waste of time to be in the middle of a reading, and then get the indicator from the device that the cuff isn\'t aligned properly.The unit\'s calibration also went out, when I first got this , the reading was within 5 points of a manual (stethoscope + cuff ) reading (about the same as the doctor\'s office). That\'s good enough IMO.After a couple of weeks, the machine locked up during a reading, three times in a row, subsequent readings were about 15 points off, compared to a manual reading (I had a friend, Nurse, take mine manually for comparison.)According to things I\'ve read on \"how to take blood pressure\", the 1st heartbeat you hear in the stehoscope is used to determine systolic. Well , this unit has a heart rate/beat indicator, and I watched the unit\'s heart beat indicator flash and noted the # , my BP\'s systolic should have matched that but was 11 points below! what in the world??So I learned how to take blood pressure manually, and that was consistent. While the machine is sensitive enough to detect the initial systolic heartbeat, it seems to ignore that and kept getting worse.At this time, I\'ve returned the machine to amazon, must be defective.

I really like the memory features it has for test storage. The only knock I have on the unit is one aspect of information downloading on my laptop. The moniter has a feature that when set will check your blood pressure three times, one right after the other and give you the average. This feature I like but when you download all the stored information it downloads all the readings and not just the average.It\'s no big deal, it\'s just a lot of redundant information.

Rather than putting it into a drawer, out of sight, as I tend to do with the small ones, I am keeping this on a small bed-side table where its presence reminds me to use it. The large, easily read screen, is also a plus for my aging eyes.Most important, the readings that I am getting correspond to those I get from a doctor who has been taking my blood pressure for so long that I don\'t get the elevated, nervousness-related readings that are gotten when I am in new situations.The cuff fits my arm well and the band is easily attached. The band is wider than those on the small monitors I have used, but I find that helpful in attaching it.Displayed when the unit completes its work are the systolic bp, the diastolic bp, and the pulse. Also shown on the screen throughout the process is an \"ok\" if the cuff is properly attached, and there is a light that comes on only if an abnormal heart beat is detected.I had no trouble setting up the monitor and taking my pressure. A quick guide for getting started comes with the monitor and is easy to follow the simple steps. There is also a more detailed manual with complete instructions for all settings, connection to computer, etc.The process of taking your pressure is in three steps with a time lapse between each of the 3 measurements. Because the default time is 120 seconds, if you follow only the instructions in the quick setup guide, like I did, it will take 5 minutes to complete its work. However, if you look at pages 23-25 in the instruction manual, you will find instruction for changing the interval between measurements from 120 seconds to 60, 30, and 15. If you choose 15, the 3 measurements will be taken in little more than one minute. I am still in the process of experimenting with the 4 possibilities to see whether it makes there is any difference in the reading between the different options. If I find there is, I will add that information.I find this to be the best, most reliable monitor that I have used over the years.You have your choice of using the 4 AA batteries or plugging into electrical power. I am doing the latter. I read in the evaluation written by another owner that rechargeable batteries don\'t work well, and this is also stated in the instruction manual.

It can be used by 2 persons and their readings, up to 100 per each, are stored in the unit. From the unit itself, I can view averages over the past several weeks--by day and by night which I believe is the correct way to check blood pressure. I would have rated this 5 stars except that the software (Microsoft Health Vault) currently (March 26, 2011) does not work with this unit--it is advertised as such, but apparently the unit is so new Microsoft doesn\'t have the proper device driver available yet. I called Omron and they said it should be fixed \"any day now,\" but why would you market a product that isn\'t useable on day 1 as advertised? The important thing, I guess, is the unit works great and seems accurate. It does work with Omron\'s own software and that works well, just not the Microsoft version. The only negative about this unit (disregarding the software issue) is that I am less than thrilled with the arm cuff--I would have preferred a flexible cuff rather than the firm one that comes with this unit.I will update this review if and when I can use the Microsoft Health Vault software.Update--July 25, 2011. The drivers are now available from Microsoft for this unit.Update--November 19, 2013. I am still very pleased with this unit and will not change the rating I gave. However, Omron\'s own software that I currently use (Omron Health Management Software) worked great for me for two years until now. I upgraded my operating system from Windows 8 to 8.1 and now the software is completely \"dead\" and useless. I even tried downloading a new version after deleting the old one, and it still does not work. Word of caution before deleting the software if you have it loaded on your computer. This unit allows 100 readings for both User A and User B to retained in the BP unit itself. However, when I deleted my software, all the readings over the past couple of years are now gone--I did not realize the unit itself only retained 100 readings for User A and User B (200 in total). So if you have upgraded to Windows 8.1, wait for a \"software patch\" from Omron to fix this issue, OR be sure to download into a PDF or Excel spreadsheet your historical readings before deleting the software from your computer.

I took the measurements on both monitors several times. It is normal for results to vary a little but they were generally similar from run to run.

To power it you have the option of 4 AAA batteries or an adapter. I think the adapter is advisable as it will more than pay for itself over time and you will never have to worry about \"low\" batteries. The monitor does not function properly if the batteries are low, and there is a low battery indicator that tells you when this condition exists.There is really no way to know how accurate it is as so many factors influence blood pressure at any time. Blood pressure is not like hair color or eye color that stays the same, rather it is like your pulse that is every changing unless you are lying motionless in your bed.I know my blood pressure is one thing that I don\'t have trouble with at this time, but the readings I am getting are a bit lower than I get at the doctor\'s office. I also have an Omron and when I took my blood pressure with it for comparison, that reading was also a bit lower than on my last visit to the doctor but in the same ballpark as the reading with this LotFancy monitor. This gives me confidence in the reliability of this monitor even though I don\'t know about its accuracy.In any case, one reading tells you little, as is also true of multiple readings taken at different times of the day. The best way to use any blood pressure monitor is to make the conditions each time the same, meaning same time of day, same arm, the arm in the same position, etc. If you get about the same reading each time when the conditions are the same that is positive, unless your doctor is trying to lower your blood pressure. However, if you suddenly get a big jump or an upward trend, that is definitely something to report to your doctor.A plus for this monitor compared with my Omron is that will remember the readings for 4 different users.

I wish they would include a power adapter but it\'s not a big deal.Accuracy wise I still prefer my Omron .Again its not too far but still there is some thing that need a little tweaking.When you put the cuff on your upper arm, it\'s really comfortable.One suggestion from me is that when you use this monitor, try to be steady . If you shake you\'ll get an inaccurate result. Its not too bulky to carry around. I love the portable size.Overall I am pretty impressed with my purchase and the performance of this blood pressure monitor.Finally I would like to thank AMazona and LotFancy (SEJOY) for providing me this blood pressure monitor at a discounted price for my honest and absolutely unbiased review.Thanks again and Peace :)As luck would have it I received this BP monitor a few days before I went in for my annual checkup so I brought it with me. It was pretty much dead-on with the BP reading I got at the doctor\'s office. My doctor was happy that I got one and said to just bring it in with me and he\'d scroll through the history to see if there were any abnormalities.This one is a better than some of the other monitors but I\'m a \"full feature\" kind of guy and I figure I\'ll be using this for a number of years. This one is the best.','Great little portable blood pressure monitor. Well job done LotFancy'),(180,'Anita','on February 19, 2016','B012EU1RWI',5,'I bough this BP monitor for my mom. First thing that you should keep in mind is that it doesn\'t come with batteries or an adapter. I don’t like that , but it is stated on items description “Requires 4 AAA batteries (not included) or AC adaptor 6V 1A (available separately) “. The adapter is a common one Output: 6V, 1A (1000 mA) , Plug specification\'ID: 2.1 mm; OD: 5.5 mm;Center. If you think you don’t have this you can buy it too. You can also use batteries (they do not come with product.)This is an upper arm band blood pressure monitor, I find this better and comfortable then using wrist monitor and more accurate. The wrap fits nicely and its easy to put it on, It even fits my child\'s arm correctly. Once you press the start button it automatically pressurizes and depressurizes it. The display is Quite large and easy to read. It stores up to 30 readings of 4 people which is great so that you can track the progress. Although I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would gladly pay full price for this product.

For whatever reason, they just do not give me consistent or accurate readings-as measured against those in a doctor\'s office. My arm is normal sized-maybe I am just dense?Anyway, this is one of the few machines I have found that is consistently in agreement with the machine my doctor uses. As other reviewers have done, I have brought this machine with me and had its readings checked against a known standard, and got the same results.The machine shipped with multiple cuffs and a nicely-made zippered carrying case in which the machine and cuffs actually fit!The unit seems well made, and things fit together without it feeling cheap. The unit is bigger than you might expect- more of a table-top size than handheld, and will not fit in your pocket or purse. It also has a small area where notes can be displayed- or the little BP guide that ships with the unit.I have been using it for about 3 months now, and with no problems. It has a feature whereby it takes three readings, and averages the results. It also appears to discard any outlying readings, so occasionally it takes 4 readings-which I am sure results in a much more accurate reading.Highlights: 1. It is simple to operate. Put on the cuff- which is well marked for orientation- and press the button. 2. It fits into its carrying case without a lot of gyrations...not always the case with home health equipment 3. The batteries have lasted at least 3 months 4. The display is large, and lights up when the test is complete. Easy to read. 5. It does support 2 users, meaning it keeps their results separate. 6. Ships with a USB cable so you can download results to PC. 7. Also has a memory feature, which will show you averages and historical results for each user.Lowlights: 1. The PC software is a pain. Rather than a spreadsheet it uses something that looks like XML, and it is clumsy and rather unintuitive. My first effort at printing something to take to my doctor looked quite silly, and it took a little bit of work to get the data into excel. 2. The unit only supports 2 distinct users. Works great for my wife and I, but we leave the unit out on a table, and guests occasionally want to try it...something I encourage. A third user, or a guest mode would have been great.Summary: Great unit, glad I bought it. Gives accurate, repeatable results with a minimum of fuss.

But some of the frills need work. The ability to send readings to a computer is still useful, but the included software program seems cheaply and hastily designed and is awkward to use, with poor documentation. The ability to store readings for two different users also is a good idea, but there needs to be a button dedicated to switching between the users; having one button both for changing time and for changing users is confusing and can be frustrating; moreover, the indicator number that indicates the user is so small as to be difficult to see. And there needs to be a way for guests to take readings that don\'t get stored for either user.

I especially like the average feature. Slide a button and when you request a reading, it takes three readings while you have the cuff on and then records the average. Software is easy to use and provides tabular and graphical data for diastolic, systolic and pulse. Just attach the monitor via USB cable for download. Also saves up to 99 readings each for two people. The irregular heartbeat detector picked up my wife\'s known condition.My wife thought it pumped up to much, but does not bother me.

I\'ll just compare the two monitors since I like them both for different reasons.(1) I like that the Microlife has the option of giving you an \"average\" BP reading. It accomplishes this by taking your BP three times in succession and then simply averaging its findings. I\'m not sure if it really makes a difference, but I feel that this probably improves accuracy a bit. The Omron does not have this feature. (1a) Even with the \"averaging\", the readings between the two monitors seem very close so either they\'re both right or both wrong (unlikely). Maybe I didn\'t need to upgrade the Omron? Oh well...(2) The cuff that comes with the Microlife seems a little flimsy and therefore is a bit of a pain to get properly positioned on your upper arm - especially if you\'re doing it yourself. The Omron does not have this problem - it\'s very easy and very comfortable. On the plus side, the velcro on the Microlife is a lot stronger than that of the Omron. It doesn\'t feel like its coming apart when inflating as the Omron can at times. (2a) The Microlife cuff also seems much more susceptible to BP variations depending on how tight its wrapped around your upper arm. If you wrap it too tight, your BP reading will be much higher than if you wrap it less tightly. This is not as much of an issue with the Omron. (I know you\'re supposed to wrap it so that you can get two fingers underneath, but we\'re all human and are not going to wrap it the same exact way every time.)(3) The inflating tube that connects the cuff to the unit is very short (too short) on the Microlife. If you inadvertently move your arm too quickly, you\'ll drag the unit off the table. Not a problem with the Omron.(4) The Microlife comes with BP tracking software. It\'s a nice idea, but really doesn\'t do anything that you couldn\'t just as easily do on an Excel spreadsheet, or a piece of paper for that matter. (4a) I had to download the software from the Microlife website because the disc that was shipped with my monitor arrived in pieces. I was surprised at how much hard drive space the software takes since it really isn\'t a slick looking program. It allows you to enter some basic personal information and, once you\'ve got your profile set up, you can connect the unit to your computer via a USB cable and download your BP readings. Once downloaded, the program gives you a little summary along with a graph. Again - nothing that Excel couldn\'t do just as easily.(5) The noise! The Microlife is much louder than the Omron as it\'s inflating the cuff. Inflating time is also longer with the Microlife, even when not using the 3-reading averaging option. If you do use the averaging, multiply inflation time by 3.(6) Both machines take your pulse. The Microlife attempts to detect heart rate irregularities and will start beeping if it thinks you\'ve got an arrhythmia. Nice feature, but I\'m not sure what criteria it uses to determine this since it\'s not explained very well in the manual.(7) The Microlife comes with both the Medium &amp; Large cuffs. No need to buy the extra cuff if you\'re a big person.Conclusion: Bottom line is the Microlife seems to be accurate which is the most important thing. Would I buy another one? Not sure. It certainly works well enough, but I think my Omron is doing just about everything the Microlife does a little more quickly and a little more quietly.','Pretty good but a few issues'),(199,'Allison W.','on February 10, 2013','B001ECQ46C',1,'I have been taking my blood pressure throughout my pregnancy and bought this one specifically because of all of the glowing reviews on here.

Then a few seconds later, we used my machine on my other arm. 145/95. What???? This was very strange so the nurse said, okay let\'t try again in a few minutes. So she has me sit on the exam table for a few minutes and try again. This time it\'s even higher! 160/98!
